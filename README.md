# SQL_basics

Hello Everyone, I have created this repository to help understand the basic concepts of SQL.

awesome-chocolates-data.sql is the database file which I downloaded from the internet
to have a hands on practise of the SQL queries.

This file can be imported to create a new database with the required sample data.

Below are the concepts which I have learned with the help of this sample database

    How to use SELECT statement to answer business questions
    Working with WHERE clause
    Using AND, OR, NOT and combining them to create complex queries.
    Sorting query results using ORDER BY
    Combining data from two or more tables using JOINS
    Creating reports with GROUP BY

This dataset came with an additional questions for practise. Below are those mentioned questions;

INTERMEDIATE PROBLEMS
ðŸ‘‰ You need to combine various concepts covered in the video to solve these

1. Print details of shipments (sales) where amounts are > 2,000 and boxes are <100?
2. How many shipments (sales) each of the sales persons had in the month of January 2022?
3. Which product sells more boxes? Milk Bars or Eclairs?
4. Which product sold more boxes in the first 7 days of February 2022? Milk Bars or Eclairs?
5. Which shipments had under 100 customers & under 100 boxes? Did any of them occur on Wednesday?

HARD PROBLEMS
ðŸ‘‰ These require concepts not covered in the video

1. What are the names of salespersons who had at least one shipment (sale) in the first 7 days of January 2022?
2. Which salespersons did not make any shipments in the first 7 days of January 2022?
3. How many times we shipped more than 1,000 boxes in each month?
4. Did we ship at least one box of â€˜After Ninesâ€™ to â€˜New Zealandâ€™ on all the months?
5. India or Australia? Who buys more chocolate boxes on a monthly basis?

I have created seperate files for both the problem types .
